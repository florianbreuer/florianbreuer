<p>In this strand of Math1120 we are going to look at techniques for finding solutions to differential equations. There is no one technique that will solve all differential equations and there are differential equations for which we can only approximate solutions. However, the methods that have been developed usually work for a particular type or class of differential equation. Thus it is important to be able to classify our differential equations into these various classes. We will learn how to do this as we go along. As a first step in this direction we need some basic definitions and terminology.</p>
