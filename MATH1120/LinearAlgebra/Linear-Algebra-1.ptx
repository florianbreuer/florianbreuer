In the special case in which <m>b=0</m> the equation is called <term>homogeneous</term>. (Of course when there are only a small number of variables, <m>2</m> or <m>3</m> say, it is common to use completely different labels (such as <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m>) for the variables rather than to use subscripts (such as <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_3</m>).)

            <example>
                <p>
                    The following is a homogeneous system of three linear equations in four unknowns.

                You should already be familiar with solving systems of linear equations involving two equations in two variables and interpreting the solution in terms of lines in the plane.

                <answer>
                <p>We can interpret the solution <m>(x,y)=(2,-3)</m> as the point in the plane at which the straight lines represented by the equations <m>2x-3y=13</m> and <m>x-y=5</m> intersect.</p>

                        Multiplying the second equation by <m>2</m> and then subtracting this from the first equation gives <m>y=-3</m>. Substituting this result into either of the original equations gives <m>x=2</m>. Thus the solution is <m>(x,y)=(2,-3)</m>.

                <p>The solution set is <m>(x,y)=\left(t,\frac{4}{3}-\frac{2}{3}t\right)</m>. The geometric interpretation of this system of linear equations is that both equations represent the same line.</p>
                </answer>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        Multiplying the first equation by <m>2</m> and then subtracting this from the second equation gives <m>0=0</m>. This tells us that any values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> that satisfy the first equation will also satisfy the second equation. Thus there are infinitely many solutions. We may choose <m>x</m> (say) to be anything we like, and then find a corresponding value for <m>y</m> (from either equation). So if we set <m>x=t</m>, then
                        <me>y=\frac{4}{3}-\frac{2}{3}t</me>
                        and the solution set is
                        <me>(x,y)=\left(t,\frac{4}{3}-\frac{2}{3}t\right)</me>
                        Thus, the parameter <m>t</m> labels the infinite family of solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The geometric interpretation of this system of linear equations is that both equations represent the same line (as shown in <xref ref="Fig-Same_line"/>).
                        <figure xml:id="Fig-Same_line">
                            <image source="./LinearAlgebra/Images/1/figure2.png" width="60%"/>
                        </figure>
                        Note that the solution written in terms of the parameter <m>t</m> can be interpreted as a vector equation for the line. By writing the solution as
                        <me>(x,y)=\left(0,\frac{4}{3}\right)+t\left(1,-\frac{2}{3}\right)</me>
                        we can see that the line passes through the point <m>\left(0,\frac{4}{3}\right)</m> and is parallel to the vector <m>\left(1,-\frac{2}{3}\right)</m>.

                <answer>
                <p>There are no solutions. Geometrically, this system of linear equations can be interpreted as two parallel lines in the plane.</p>
                </answer>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        Multiplying the first equation by <m>2</m> and then subtracting this from the second equation gives <m>0=-21</m>. This tells us that no values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> will satisfy these equations. Thus there are no solutions. A system of equations with no solution is said to be <term>inconsistent</term>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Geometrically, this system of linear equations can be interpreted as two parallel lines in the plane, as shown in <xref ref="Fig-Parallel_lines"/>.

            <p>
            	The above (simple) examples illustrate two important facts that hold for all systems of linear equations. Firstly:
            </p>

            <definition>
                <p>
                    A system of <m>m</m> linear equations in <m>n</m> unknowns has either
                </p>
                <p><ul>
                    <li><p>A unique solution,</p></li>
                    <li><p>An infinite number of solutions, or</p></li>
                    <li><p>No solution</p></li>
                </ul></p>
            </definition>

            <p>
                Thus it is impossible, for example, for a system of linear equations to have exactly two or exactly three solutions. (We will see why this is later.) Secondly, we cannot tell which of these cases (i.e. a unique solution, infinitely many solutions or no solution) applies simply by counting the number of equations and unknowns.
            </p>
            <p>
                For systems of two linear equations in two unknowns we have seen that we can solve the system via the "substitution method" (viz. making one variable the subject of one equation and then substituting this into the second equation) or the "elimination method" (viz. adding a multiple of one equation to other). For larger system of equations this basic idea can still be used but the working can be become quite messy. In the following sections we will look at a systematic way of solving a system of <m>m</m> linear equations in <m>n</m> unknowns using matrices.

                Note that sometimes a partition line is put before the last column in an augmented matrix to emphasise that the last column represents the right hand side of the equations while the remaining columns represent the coefficients of the variables in the system. The matrix without the last column is called the <term>coefficient matrix</term> for the system of equations.

            <p>
                Two systems of linear equations are said to be <term>equivalent</term> if they have the same number of variables and have the same solution sets.
            </p>

            <example>

                <p>
                    It turns out that the systems of linear equations in <xref ref="Ex-Write_down_the_system_of_equations"/> are equivalent, i.e.
                    <md>

                    </md>
                    The solution to these equivalent systems can be seen from the system on the right whereas they are not at all obvious from the system on the left.
                </p>
            </example>

            <p>
                Notice that, given a system of linear equations, we can produce an equivalent system by doing any one of the following:
            </p>
            <p><ul>
                <li><p>Multiplying any one equation by a non-zero constant</p></li>

                <li><p>Adding any multiple of one equation to another</p></li>

                    The following systems of linear equations are equivalent because we have just written the equations in a different order.

                Thus the strategy for solving a system of linear equations will be to apply the above operations in a systematic way to produce an equivalent system from which we can determine the solution (such as that given in <xref ref="Ex-Write_down_the_system_of_equations"/><m>(b)</m>). This strategy, in the form described below, is called <term>Gauss-Jordon Elimination</term>. In order to describe this strategy we need some terminology.

                    In <term>Gauss-Jordon Elimination</term>, the augmented matrix associated with the system of linear equations is systematically row reduced to reduced row-echelon form by:
                </p>
                <p><ul>
                    <li><p>Obtaining a 1 in entry <m>a_{11}</m></p></li>
                    <li><p>Obtaining <m>0</m>'s in the remainder of column <m>1</m> by using the elementary row operation of adding multiples of row <m>1</m> to another row.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Obtaining a 1 in entry <m>a_{22}</m></p></li>
                    <li><p>Obtaining <m>0</m>'s in the remainder of column <m>2</m> by using the elementary row operation of adding multiples of row <m>2</m> to another row.</p></li>
	                <li><p>And so on across the columns.</p></li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>
                    The solution is then read off from the equivalent system represented by the matrix in reduced row-echelon form
                </p>
            </definition>

            <example>
                <p>
                    Use Gauss Jordon Elimination to solve the following system of linear equations:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>2x+3y \amp =1</mrow>
                        <mrow>3x-4y \amp =10</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        The augmented matrix for this system is
                        <me>\left(\begin{array}{c c | c} 2 \amp 3 \amp 1 \\ 3 \amp -4 \amp 10 \end{array}\right)</me>
                        We now want to row reduce this matrix to reduced row-echelon form. Following the steps as outlined:
                        <md>
                            <mrow> \begin{pmatrix} 2 \amp 3 \amp 1 \\ 3 \amp -4 \amp 10 \end{pmatrix} \amp \sim \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp \frac{3}{2} \amp \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 \amp -\frac{17}{2} \amp \frac{17}{2} \end{pmatrix}   \begin{matrix} R_1'=R_1/2 \\ \hspace{8mm} R_2'=R_2-3R_1' \end{matrix}</mrow>
                            <mrow> \amp \sim \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \amp 2 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \end{pmatrix}  \begin{matrix} \hspace{15mm} R_1'=R_1-3R_2'/2 \\ \hspace{10mm} R_2'=-2R_2/17 \end{matrix} </mrow>
                        </md>
                        We can now read off the solution as
                        <me>(x,y)=(2,-1)</me>
                        Of course we can check that this solution is correct by substituting these values into the original equations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In doing the row reduction here were had to use fractions. It is possible to apply the elementary row operations in a manner that avoids the fractions until the last steps. However you have to be very careful in doing this that you don’t lose some of the <m>0</m>’s that you have already created and hence start going around in circles!

                    Use Gauss Jordon Elimination to solve the following system of linear equations.

                <solution>
                    <p>
                        The augmented matrix for this system is
                        <me>\begin{pmatrix} 2 \amp 6 \amp 2 \amp 4 \\ 3 \amp 2 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\ 2 \amp 3 \amp 0 \amp 1 \end{pmatrix} </me>
                        Now using the steps as outlined to reduce this to reduced row-echelon form:
                        <md>
                            <mrow> \begin{pmatrix} 2 \amp 6 \amp 2 \amp 4 \\ 3 \amp 2 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\ 2 \amp 3 \amp 0 \amp 1 \end{pmatrix} \amp \sim \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 3 \amp 1 \amp 2 \\ 0 \amp -7 \amp -2 \amp -6 \\ 0 \amp -3 \amp -2 \amp -3 \end{pmatrix}  \begin{matrix} R_1'=R_1/2 \\ \hspace{10mm} R_2'=R_2-3R_1' \\ \hspace{10mm} R_3'=R_3-2R_1' \end{matrix} </mrow>
                            <mrow> \amp \sim \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{7} \amp -\frac{4}{7} \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{2}{7} \amp \frac{6}{7} \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp -\frac{8}{7} \amp -\frac{3}{7} \end{pmatrix}  \hspace{6mm} \begin{matrix} \hspace{5mm} R_1'=R_1-3R_2' \\  R_2'=-R_2/7 \\ \hspace{5.5mm} R_3'=R_3+3R_2' \end{matrix}</mrow>
                            <mrow> \amp \sim \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp -\frac{5}{8} \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp \frac{3}{4} \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp \frac{3}{8} \end{pmatrix}   \begin{matrix} \hspace{14.5mm} R_1'=R_1-R_3'/7 \\ \hspace{16.5mm} R_2'=R_2-2R_3'/7 \\ \hspace{10mm} R_3'=-7R_3/8 \end{matrix}</mrow>

                        </md>
                        Thus the solution is
                        <me>(x,y,z)=\left(-\frac{5}{8},\frac{3}{4},\frac{3}{8}\right)</me>
                    </p>
