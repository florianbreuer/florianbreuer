<p>Though we all seem to remember Pierre de Fermat for his "Last" theorem, he did much more than just scribble notes in the margins of books. In fact, Fermat was one of the last great mathematicians to pursue mathematics as an aside to his normal life; he was a lawyer and magistrate. Due to this he is known as the "Prince of Amateurs." In this lecture we will discuss some of the mathematics behind the man.</p>
