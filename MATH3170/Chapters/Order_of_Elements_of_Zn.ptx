                <p>
                Let <m>n\gt 1</m> and <m>\gcd(a, n) = 1.</m> The <term>order of <m>a</m> modulo <m>n</m></term> is the smallest positive integer <m>k</m> such that <m>a^k\equiv 1\pmod{n}.</m>
                </p>
            </definition>

            <example>
                <p>
                Consider the elements in <m>\mathbb{Z}_8.</m> The only elements with <m>\gcd(a, 8) = 1</m> are those in <m>U_8;</m> that is 
                <me>U_8 = \{1, 3, 5, 7\}.</me>
                Now trivially <m>1</m> has order <m>1</m>. Note that <m>3^2 = 9\equiv 1\pmod{8}, 5^2 = 25\equiv 1\pmod{8},</m> and <m>7^2 = 49\equiv 1\pmod{8},</m> so <m>3,5,7</m> all have order <m>2</m> modulo <m>8.</m>
                </p>
            </example>

            <example>
                <p>
                Let <m>p</m> be a prime. Then <m>p-1</m> has order <m>2</m> modulo <m>p,</m> since 
                <me>(p-1)^2 = p^2-2p + 1\equiv 1\pmod{p}.</me>
                </p>
            </example>

            <p>
            The condition that <m>\gcd(a, n) = 1</m> is paramount. For if <m>\gcd(a, n)\gt 1,</m> then the congruence 
            <me>ax\equiv 1\pmod{n}</me>
            has no solution so then for every <m>k\in\mathbb{N},</m>
            <me>a^k\not\equiv 1\pmod{n}.</me>
            </p>

            <theorem>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                    If <m>a\equiv b\pmod{n},</m> then <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have the same order modulo <m>n.</m>
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                    If <m>a\equiv b\pmod{n},</m> then <m>a^i \equiv b^i \pmod{n}</m> for every <m>i</m>. The result follows.
                    </p>
                </proof>
            </theorem>

            <theorem>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                    Let <m>a</m> have order <m>k</m> modulo <m>n.</m> Then <m>a^h\equiv 1\pmod{n}</m> if and only if <m>k\vert h;</m> in particular, <m>k\vert \varphi(n).</m>
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                    Let <m>a</m> have order <m>k</m> modulo <m>n.</m>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Suppose that <m>k\vert h,</m> then <m>h = kj</m> for some <m>j.</m> Since <m>a^k\equiv 1\pmod{n},</m> we have
                    <me>a^h=(a^k)^j\equiv 1^j=1 \pmod{n}.</me>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Conversely, let <m>h\geq 1</m> be such that <m>a^h\equiv 1\pmod{n}.</m> By the division algorithm, there exist <m>q, r</m> with <m>h = qk + r,</m> where <m>0\leq r \lt k.</m> So 
                    <me>a^h=a^{qk+r}=(a^k)^qa^r.</me>
                    Since <m>a^h\equiv 1 \pmod{n}</m> and <m>a^k\equiv 1 \pmod{n},</m> we have that <m>a^r\equiv 1 \pmod{n}.</m> But <m>k</m> is the smallest positive integer such that <m>a^k\equiv 1 \pmod{n},</m> thus <m>r = 0,</m> and hence <m>k\vert h.</m>
                    </p>
                </proof>
            </theorem>

            <example>
                <p>
                Consider <m>2\in\mathbb{Z}_{13}.</m> We know from the above theorem that <m>2</m> has order dividing <m>\varphi(13) = 12;</m> so the possible orders of <m>2</m> modulo <m>13,</m> are <m>1,2,3,4,6,</m> and <m>12.</m> Now 
                <me>2^1\equiv 2 \hspace{5mm} 2^2\equiv 4 \hspace{5mm} 2^3\equiv 8 \hspace{5mm} 2^4\equiv 3 \hspace{5mm} 2^6\equiv 12 \hspace{5mm} 2^{12}\equiv 1 \pmod{13},</me>
                so <m>2</m> has order <m>12</m> modulo <m>13.</m>
                </p>
            </example>

            <theorem>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                    If <m>a</m> has order <m>k</m> modulo <m>n,</m> then <m>a^i\equiv a^j \pmod{n}</m> if and only if <m>i\equiv j \pmod{k}.</m>
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                    Let <m>a</m> have order <m>k</m> modulo <m>n.</m> If <m>a^i\equiv a^j \pmod{n},</m> then <m>a^{i-j}\equiv 1\pmod{n},</m> so that by theorem <m>k\vert i-j</m> and so <m>i\equiv j \pmod{k}.</m>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If <m>i\equiv j \pmod{k},</m> then <m>i = j + qk</m> for some <m>q.</m> So
                    <me>a^i=a^{j+qk}=a^j(a^k)^q\equiv a^j \pmod{n}</me>
                    since <m>a^k\equiv 1 \pmod{n}.</m>
                    </p>
                </proof>
            </theorem>

            <corollary>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                    If <m>a</m> has order <m>k</m> modulo <m>n,</m> then the integers <m>a, a^2, a^3,..., a^k</m> are incongruent modulo <m>n.</m> 
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                    If <m>a^j\equiv a^i \pmod{n},</m> for <m>1\leq i\lt j\leq k,</m> then we know by the previous theorem that <m>i\equiv j \pmod{k},</m> which is impossible under the conditions on <m>i</m> and <m>j.</m>
                    </p>

            </corollary>

            <p>
            The order of an element, and of powers of an element are related in the following way.
            </p>

            <theorem>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                    If <m>a</m> has order <m>k</m> modulo <m>n</m> and <m>h\gt 0,</m> then <m>a^h</m> has order <m>\dfrac{k}{\gcd(h,k)}</m> modulo <m>n.</m>
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                    Let <m>d = \gcd(h, k).</m> Then we may write <m>h = h_1d</m> and <m>k = k_1d,</m> with <m>\gcd(h_1, k_1) = 1.</m> Now
                    <me>(a^h)^{k_1}=(a^{h_1d})^{k/d}=(a^k)^{h_1}\equiv 1\pmod{n}.</me>
                    If we assume that <m>a^h</m> has order <m>r</m> modulo <m>n,</m> then we know that <m>r\vert k_1.</m> On the other hand, because <m>a</m> has order <m>k</m> modulo <m>n,</m> 
                    <me>a^{hr}=(a^h)^r\equiv 1\pmod{n}</me>
                    gives <m>k\vert hr,</m> so <m>k_1d\vert h_1dr</m> so <m>k_1\vert h_1r.</m> But <m>\gcd(k_1, h_1) = 1,</m> so <m>k_1\vert r</m> by Euclid's Lemma. Thus <m>r = k_1,</m> and 
                    <me>r = k_1 =\frac{k}{d}=\frac{k}{\gcd(k,h)}.</me>
                    </p>
                </proof>
            </theorem>

            <corollary>
                <p>
                Let <m>a</m> have order <m>k</m> modulo <m>n.</m> Then <m>a^h</m> also has order <m>k</m> if and only if <m>\gcd(h, k) = 1.</m>

            <p>
            If <m>\gcd(a, n) = 1</m> and <m>a</m> has order <m>\varphi(n)</m> modulo <m>n,</m> then <m>a</m> is a <term>primitive root</term> of the integer <m>n.</m>
            </p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>
            <m>2</m> is a primitive root of <m>13.</m>

        </example>

        <example>
            <p>
            If <m>n\gt 1</m> and <m>F_n = 2^{2^{n}}+1</m> is a prime, then <m>2</m> is not a primitive root of <m>F_n.</m> (Clearly <m>2</m> is a primitive root of <m>F_1 = 5.</m>) Note that
            <me>2^{2^{n+1}}-1=(2^{2^n}+1)(2^{2^n}-1),</me>
            so that
            <me>2^{2^{n+1}}\equiv 1\pmod{F_n}</me>
            which implies that the order of <m>2</m> modulo <m>F_n</m> does not exceed <m>2^{n+1}.</m> But if <m>F_n</m> is assumed to be prime, then 
            <me>\varphi(F_n) = F_n-1 = 2^{2^n}.</me>
            Since <m>n\gt 1,</m> it is clear that <m>2^{2^n}\gt 2^{n+1},</m> so that <m>2</m> cannot be a primitive root of <m>F_n.</m>

                Since <m>d\vert p-1</m> we have <m>p-1 = dk</m> for some <m>k.</m> Thus
                <me>x^{p-1}- 1 = (x^d-1)(x^{d(k-1)} + x^{d(k-2)}+\cdots +x^{d}+1)=(x^d-1)f(x).</me>
                Now <m>f(x)</m> has degree <m>d(k-1) = p-1-d,</m> so by a previous theorem, we have that
                <me>f(x) \equiv 0\pmod{p}</me>
                has at most <m>p-1-d</m> solutions. Now by Fermat's Little Theorem we know that
                <me>x^{p-1}\equiv 1\pmod{p}</me>
                has exactly <m>\varphi(p) = p-1</m> solutions, precisely <m>x = 1, 2, 3,..., p-1.</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                Any solution of <m>x^{p-1}\equiv 1\pmod{p}</m> is that is not a solution of <m>f(x)\equiv 0\pmod{p},</m> must satisfy <m>x^d-1 \equiv 0\pmod{p}.</m> Since <m>x^{p-1}-1 \equiv 0\pmod{p}</m> has <m>p-1</m> solutions and <m>f(x)\equiv 0\pmod{p}</m> has at most <m>p-1-d</m> solutions, there are at least 
                <me>p-1-(p-1-d) = d</me>
                solutions to <m>x^d-1\equiv 0\pmod{p}.</m> Again since <m>x^d-1 \equiv 0\pmod{p}</m> has at most <m>d</m> solutions, we have that the congruence <m>x^d-1 \equiv 0\pmod{p}</m> has exactly <m>d</m> solutions.

                <p>
                If <m>p</m> is a prime and <m>d\vert p-1,</m> then there are exactly <m>\varphi(d)</m> incongruent integers having order <m>d</m> modulo <m>p.</m>
                </p>

            <proof>
                <p>
                Let <m>d\vert p-1</m> and <m>f(d)</m> denote the number of integers <m>k, 1\leq k\leq p-1,</m> that have order <m>d</m> modulo <m>p.</m> Because each integer between <m>1</m> and <m>p-1</m> has order <m>d</m> for some <m>d\vert p- 1,</m> 
                <me>p-1 = \sum_{d\vert p-1} f(d).</me>
                Recall that also we have
                <me>p-1 = \sum_{d\vert p-1} \varphi(d),</me>
                so that 
                <me>\sum_{d\vert p-1}\varphi(d)=\sum_{d\vert p-1}f(d).</me>
                To show that <m>f(d) = \varphi(d)</m> for each divisor <m>d</m> of <m>p -1,</m> it is enough to show that <m>f(d)\geq \varphi(d).</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                To this end, let <m>d</m> be a divisor of <m>p-1.</m> If <m>f(d) = 0,</m> then we are done, so suppose that <m>f(d)\gt 0;</m> that is, there is an integer <m>a</m> with order <m>d</m> modulo <m>p.</m> Then the <m>d</m> integers 
                <me>a, a^2,..., a^d</me>
                are incongruent modulo <m>p</m> and each of them satisfies the polynomial congruence
                <me>x^d-1\equiv 0 \pmod{p}.</me>
                Since there can be only <m>d</m> solutions, we have found all of them. It follows that any integer <m>a</m> having order <m>d</m> modulo <m>p</m> is congruent to one of <m>a, a^2,..., a^d.</m> But only <m>\varphi(d)</m> of these powers have order <m>d</m> modulo <m>p,</m> namely those <m>a^k</m> where <m>\gcd(k, d) = 1.</m> Thus <m>f(d) = \varphi(d).</m>
                </p>

                Because <m>4\vert p-1,</m> there is an <m>a</m> having order <m>4</m> modulo <m>p,</m> so that 
                <me>a^4\equiv 1\pmod{p}.</me>
                So
                <me>a^4-1\equiv (a^2-1)(a^2 + 1) \equiv 0\pmod{p}.</me>
                This means that either
                <me>a^2-1\equiv 0\pmod{p} \hspace{5mm} \mathrm{or} \hspace{5mm} a^2 + 1\equiv 0\pmod{p}.</me>
                If <m>a^2-1\equiv 0\pmod{p},</m> then <m>a</m> has order <m>2</m> modulo <m>p,</m> a contradiction. Thus <m>a^2+1\equiv 0\pmod{p},</m> and so for this <m>a,</m> we have <m>a^2\equiv -1\pmod{p}.</m>

            <p>
            We now consider composite numbers for a moment.

            <theorem>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                    If <m>\gcd(m, n) = 1,</m> where <m>m, n\gt 2,</m> then the integer <m>mn</m> has no primitive roots.
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                    Consider an integer <m>a</m> for which <m>\gcd(a, mn) = 1.</m> Then <m>\gcd(a, m) = 1</m> and <m>\gcd(a, n) = 1.</m> Set <m>h = \mathrm{lcm}(\varphi(n), \varphi(m))</m> and <m>d = \gcd(\varphi(n), \varphi(m)).</m> Since <m>\varphi(n)</m> and <m>\varphi(m)</m> are both even, we have <m>d\geq 2.</m> So 
                    <me>h =\frac{\varphi(n)\varphi(m)}{d}\leq\frac{\varphi(mn)}{2}.</me>
                    Now
                    <me>a^h = (a^{\varphi(m)})^{\varphi(n)/d} \equiv 1^{\varphi(n)/d}\equiv 1\pmod{m}</me>
                    and similarly <m>a^h \equiv 1\pmod{n}.</m> Since <m>\gcd(m, n) = 1</m> we have 
                    <me>a^h\equiv 1\pmod{mn}</me>
                    so that since <m>h\lt \varphi(mn), a</m> is not a primitive root of <m>mn.</m>

            <p>
            Admittedly, results for prime powers are more interesting. 
            </p>

            <lemma>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                    If <m>p</m> is an odd prime with primitive root <m>r,</m> then either <m>r</m> or <m>r + p</m> is a primitive root of <m>p^2.</m>
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                    Since <m>r</m> is a primitive root of <m>p,</m> we know that the order of <m>r</m> modulo <m>p</m> is <m>\varphi(p) = p-1.</m> Now let <m>n</m> be the order of <m>r</m> modulo <m>p^2.</m> Since any congruence modulo <m>p^2</m> certainly holds modulo <m>p,</m> we have that also,
                    <me>r^n\equiv 1\pmod{p}.</me>
                    Since <m>p-1</m> is the order of <m>r</m> modulo <m>p,</m> we have that <m>p-1\vert n.</m> But also, we have <m>n\vert \phi(p^2),</m> so <m>n\vert p(p-1).</m> Thus either <m>n = p-1</m> or <m>n = p(p-1).</m> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If <m>n = p(p-1)</m> we are done, so suppose that <m>n = p-1</m> and consider <m>r + p.</m> Since <m>r\equiv r + p \pmod{p}, r + p</m> is also a primitive root of <m>p.</m> So as above we have that the order <m>m</m> of <m>r + p</m> modulo <m>p^2</m> is either <m>p-1</m> or <m>p(p-1).</m> Again, if <m>m = p(p-1)</m> we are done, so suppose that <m>m = p-1.</m> Then, using the binomial theorem, we have

                        <mrow>(r + p)^{p-1} \amp = r^{p-1} + (p-1)r^{p-2}p +\binom{p-1}{2}r^{p-3}p^2+\cdots p^{p-1}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp = r^{p-1} + (p-1)pr^{p-2} \pmod{p^2}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp = 1+(p-1)pr^{p-2} \pmod{p^2}</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp = 1-pr^{p-2} \pmod{p^2}.</mrow>
                    </md>
                    Now if <m>(r + p)^{p-1}</m> is <m>1</m> modulo <m>p^2,</m> then <m>p^2\vert pr^{p-2}</m> and so <m>p\vert r^{p-2},</m> which is impossible since <m>p</m> does not divide <m>r.</m> This contradiction proves the theorem.
                    </p>
                </proof>
            </lemma>

            <theorem xml:id="Theorem_7_10">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                    A primitive root of <m>p^2</m> is a primitive root of <m>p^k</m> for any integer <m>k\geq 2.</m>
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                    We know from the previous lemma that there is a primitive root <m>r</m> of p that is also a primitive root of <m>p^2</m> such that
                    <me>r^{p-1}\not\equiv 1\pmod{p^2}.</me>
                    We show by induction that for this primitive root and for <m>k\geq 2</m> that
                    <me>r^{p^{k-2}(p-1)}\not\equiv 1\pmod{p^k}.</me>
                    The base case follows from the previous lemma. Now suppose there is some <m>k\geq 2</m> such that
                    <me>r^{p^{k-2}k(p-1)}\not\equiv 1\pmod{p^k}.</me>
                    Since <m>\gcd(r, p) = 1,</m> we have that <m>\gcd(r, p^{k-1}) = 1</m> and so using Euler's generalisation of Fermat's little theorem, we have that
                    <me>r^{p^{k-2}(p-1)}\equiv r^{\phi(p^{k-1})} \equiv 1\pmod{p^{k-1}}.</me>
                    Thus there is a <m>d</m> such that <m>r^{p^{k-2}(p-1)}=1+dp^{k-1},</m> where <m>p</m> does not divide <m>d</m> due to the induction hypothesis. As before we use the binomial theorem to give
                    <me>r^{p^{k-1}(p-1)}=(1+dp^{k-1})^p\equiv 1+dp^k \pmod{p^{k+1}}.</me>
                    Since <m>p</m> does not divide <m>d,</m> this gives the desired non-congruence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    With this result in hand, the result is quite straightforward. Given a primitive root <m>r</m> of <m>p^2</m> as above, let <m>n</m> be the order of <m>r</m> modulo <m>p^k.</m> So <m>n\vert \phi(p^k),</m> which means that <m>n\vert p^{k-1}(p-1).</m> But also, since <m>r^n\equiv 1\pmod{p^k}</m> also <m>r^n\equiv 1\pmod{p},</m> so, like before, <m>p-1\vert n.</m> Thus <m>n = p^t(p-1)</m> for some <m>t</m> in <m>\{0,...,k-1\}.</m> If <m>t\leq k-2,</m> then 
                    <me>r^{p^{k-2}(p-1)}=(r^{p^{t}(p-1)})^{p^{k-2-t}}\equiv 1\pmod{p^{k}},</me>
                    which contradicts our non-congruence proved above. Thus <m>t = k-1</m> and <m>r</m> is a primitive root of <m>p^k.</m>
                    </p>
                </proof>
            </theorem>
