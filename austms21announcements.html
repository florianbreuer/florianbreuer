  <li><b>Zoom Events</b>. The talks will be online in Zoom Events.
    This is not the same as a regular Zoom meeting that can be joined from a
    simple link.
    You will have received an email (On Tuesday 30 November)
    with a ticket to Zoom Events. This ticket
    is free, but you need a Zoom login. You can either create one, or use an
    email address (like your university email address) that is already registerd
    with Zoom. If you would like to use a different email address than the one
    you used to register for the conference, let us know.
  See <a href="https://carma.newcastle.edu.au/meetings/austms2021/#page=zoom" target="_blank">
    here</a> for more information.

  <li><b>gather.town.</b> Like last year, we'll be using gather.town as a place
    to mingle online. You can access it via a link that was sent to your
    email (On Tuesday 30 November).<br>
    We will have a meet-and-greet in gather.town on Monday evening 7-8pm,
    as well as another gathering around the time of the conference dinner.
    Besides that, gather.town will remain open throughout the conference, so
    please drop in and meet people, especially during coffee breaks.</li>
  <li><b>Discord.</b> We have set up a discord server for the conference.
    Discord is a messaging app that has a variety of discussion channels,
    including one for each session. If you let it, it can also deliver push
    notifications to your device, which is the quickest way to get updates
    about the conference.<br>
    You will have received an email (On Tuesday 30 November)
    containing the link to join Discord, along
    with instructions for signing up.
