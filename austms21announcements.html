    This is not the same as a regular Zoom meeting that can be joined from a
    simple link.
    You will have received an email (On Tuesday 30 November)
    with a ticket to Zoom Events. This ticket
    is free, but you need a Zoom login. You can either create one, or use an
    email address (like your university email address) that is already registerd
    with Zoom. If you would like to use a different email address than the one
    you used to register for the conference, let us know.
  See <a href="https://carma.newcastle.edu.au/meetings/austms2021/#page=zoom" target="_blank">

    We will have a meet-and-greet in gather.town on Monday evening 7-8pm,
    as well as another gathering around the time of the conference dinner.
    Besides that, gather.town will remain open throughout the conference, so

    about the conference.<br>
